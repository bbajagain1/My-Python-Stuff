This repository showcases my journey of learning Python using Jupyter Notebooks
and the comprehensive Udemy course titled "Become a Python Programmer and
learn one of employer's most requested skills of 2023!".

The course covers a wide range of topics, from basic Python syntax to advanced
concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and working with external libraries. 


Below are some of the key concepts and tasks I've been working on:

- String Manipulation: Demonstrates basic string operations like converting to uppercase, lowercase, and splitting.
- List Operations: Showcases adding elements to a list and counting the number of topics covered.
- Dictionary Usage: Explores adding and updating dictionary elements.
- Functions and Scope: Includes a simple function to calculate the area of a circle.
- OOP: Introduces a Course class with basic attributes and methods.
- File I/O: Creates a sample text file as part of learning file operations.
- Debugging and Error Handling: Implements basic error handling using try-except.
