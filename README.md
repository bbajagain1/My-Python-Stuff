This repository showcases my journey of learning Python using Jupyter Notebooks
and the comprehensive Udemy course titled "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python
".

The course covers a wide range of topics, from basic Python syntax to advanced
concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and working with external libraries. 


Below are some of the key concepts and tasks I've been working on:

- String Manipulation: Demonstrates basic string operations like converting to uppercase, lowercase, and splitting.
- List Operations: Showcases adding elements to a list and counting the number of topics covered.
- Dictionary Usage: Explores adding and updating dictionary elements.
- Functions and Scope: Includes a simple function to calculate the area of a circle.
- OOP: Introduces a Course class with basic attributes and methods.
- File I/O: Creates a sample text file as part of learning file operations.
- Debugging and Error Handling: Implements basic error handling using try-except.
